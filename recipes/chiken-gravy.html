    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>salt and fresh ground pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or more to taste</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place chicken breast halves between 2 sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to 1/2-inch thickness. Season with salt and pepper.</li><br>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat until it begins to shimmer, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium; cook chicken breasts in hot oil until browned and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked chicken to a warm plate and loosely cover with aluminum foil.</li><br>
      <li>Melt butter in the same skillet. Stir in flour and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook and stir until gravy begins to simmer and thicken, 1 to 2 minutes.</li><br>
      <li>Stir in green onions and chipotle chile powder.</li><br>
      <li>Return chicken breasts to the skillet and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li><br>
    </ol>
